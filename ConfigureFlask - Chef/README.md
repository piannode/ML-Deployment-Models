# Automating Deployment for ML CI/CD Pipelines via GitHub Actions 

Working as a Data Scientist, one may come across hurdles such as dependency conflicts, unfamiliarity with different environments, infrastructure configuration challenges or version issues with tools like TensorFlow. Encountering such issues while trying to run a trained model on different hosts was what led me to Chef â€” A Configuration Management tool easing the complexity of such tasks. 

A simple application has been developed leveraging sentiment analysis to gauge citizen satisfaction with State and Central Government's actions during the COVID-19 crisis.
